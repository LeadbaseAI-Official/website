========================data.js


Fetches leads from https://api.leadbaseai.in/data

Limits users with:

dailyLimit + extraLimit

10 pages/session with a 6-hour reset (using sessionStorage)

Stores user metadata in localStorage.userData

Allows CSV download of selected rows

Requires login context (email and ip) in localStorage before loading

Has country-based pagination

Controls UI visibility for table vs. selection screen



==================================== data.js

Checks if user is logged in (email and ip in localStorage.userData)

Displays username and limits (daily_limit, extra_limit, affiliates)

Fetches fresh user data from https://api.leadbaseai.in/check-user (once every 6 hours)

Falls back to cached values if API fails

Handles logout and clears storage

⚙️ Connected Logic:
This file depends on and feeds into data.js:

It ensures userData is available and up-to-date

data.js reads and respects the same limits (daily_limit, extra_limit)



=========================== login.js
✅ login.js fully parsed.

It does:

🔐 Login Flow
Gets email, name, and phone from a form

Validates input (basic regex)

Fetches client IP from https://api.ipify.org

Sends a POST to https://api.leadbaseai.in/check-user

📦 Based on response:
✅ If emailExists and ipExists:
→ Save full user to localStorage.userData → Go to /Dashboard/

⚠️ If ipExists but email doesn’t:
→ Show error: “One account already exists...”

🆕 If both don’t exist:
→ Save unverified user to localStorage.userData → Go to /quiz/

🧠 Also:
Stores ref_source from query param (used later)

Shows loading overlay during request
